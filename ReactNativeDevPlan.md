# React Native Engineer Onboarding Plan: Zero to Productive in 30 Days

## Objective
Transform new React Native engineers into productive team members in **30 days** instead of the typical **4-month ramp-up**. This accelerated timeline is achieved through structured hands-on learning, progressive mobile development challenges, and continuous feedback.

## Week 1: React Native Foundation Building
- **Day 1-2: Access & Environment**
  - Complete access provisioning (GitHub, Jira, Slack, Firebase Console)
  - Run our automated RN environment setup script (Node, Watchman, CocoaPods, Android SDK)
  - Configure iOS simulator and Android emulator with debugging tools

- **Day 3-5: React Native Architecture Immersion**
  - Complete guided walkthrough of our component structure and navigation flow
  - Watch React Native architecture video series (native modules, JS bridge, Hermes)
  - Set up Metro bundler and explore hot reloading workflow

## Week 2: First Mobile Contributions
- **Day 6-7: Initial React Native Code Submission**
  - Fix a pre-selected UI bug (component styling or layout issue)
  - Submit first PR with proper mobile testing on both iOS and Android
  - Document platform-specific differences encountered

- **Day 8-10: React Native Deep Dives**
  - Complete hands-on workshop on state management (Redux/MobX with React Native)
  - Build a reusable custom component following our mobile design system
  - Pair program on API integration with proper mobile loading states

## Week 3: Mobile Feature Development
- **Day 11-13: Cross-Platform Implementation**
  - Develop a complete feature ensuring iOS and Android compatibility
  - Implement responsive layouts for different device sizes
  - Handle offline capabilities and app state persistence

- **Day 14-15: Mobile Testing & Quality**
  - Write Jest tests for React component logic
  - Create Detox E2E tests simulating real user flows on actual devices
  - Address platform-specific edge cases identified in QA

## Week 4: Mobile Deployment & Integration
- **Day 16-18: App Deployment Pipeline**
  - Build and deploy to TestFlight and Google Play internal tracks
  - Configure app signing and versioning strategies
  - Learn mobile-specific feature flagging with Firebase Remote Config

- **Day 19-20: Mobile Team Integration**
  - Participate in sprint planning with focus on mobile roadmap
  - Present completed feature on actual devices at demo day
  - Document learnings about React Native performance optimization

## Success Metrics
By day 30, new React Native engineers will have:
1. Shipped at least one feature to both iOS and Android app stores
2. Demonstrated proficiency in cross-platform development patterns
3. Successfully debugged and resolved platform-specific issues
4. Implemented and tested responsive mobile UI components
5. Contributed to the team's React Native best practices documentation

## Supporting Resources
- Interactive component storybook (with iOS/Android toggle)
- Video tutorials on common mobile debugging workflows
- Access to device testing farm for cross-device verification
- Weekly mobile tech sync with platform specialists
- Curated learning path covering React Native performance optimization
