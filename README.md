# Engineer Onboarding Plan: Zero to Productive in 30 Days

## Objective
Transform new engineers into productive team members in **30 days** instead of the typical **4-month ramp-up**. This accelerated timeline is achieved through structured hands-on learning, progressive challenges, and continuous feedback.

## Week 1: Foundation Building
- **Day 1-2: Access & Environment**
  - Complete access provisioning (GitHub, Jira, Slack, AWS/GCP)
  - Run our automated environment setup script (Docker, dependencies, API keys)
  - Review architecture diagrams and system documentation

- **Day 3-5: Codebase Immersion**
  - Complete guided code walkthrough with senior engineer
  - Watch architecture video series (5 modules, 10 min each)
  - Set up daily 15-minute check-ins with assigned mentor

## Week 2: First Contributions
- **Day 6-7: Initial Code Submission**
  - Fix a pre-selected beginner-friendly bug
  - Submit first PR and navigate code review process
  - Document learnings and blockers in onboarding journal

- **Day 8-10: Technical Deep Dives**
  - Complete hands-on workshop on state management (Redux/RTK Query)
  - Build a simple component using the design system
  - Pair program with senior developer on API integration task

## Week 3: Feature Development
- **Day 11-13: End-to-End Implementation**
  - Develop a complete small feature with defined acceptance criteria
  - Write comprehensive unit tests (Jest) for new code
  - Participate in code reviews for other team members

- **Day 14-15: Testing & Quality**
  - Create E2E tests (Detox) for your feature
  - Address QA feedback and refine implementation
  - Document feature for knowledge base

## Week 4: Shipping & Integration
- **Day 16-18: Deployment Pipeline**
  - Deploy feature through staging environment
  - Monitor and troubleshoot deployment issues
  - Learn feature flagging and rollout strategies

- **Day 19-20: Team Integration**
  - Participate in sprint planning with own ticket assignments
  - Present completed work at demo day
  - Conduct retrospective on onboarding experience

## Success Metrics
By day 30, new engineers will have:
1. Shipped at least one feature to production
2. Demonstrated proficiency in the codebase and development workflow
3. Participated in full sprint cycle from planning to retrospective
4. Established effective collaboration with team members
5. Created documentation that improves onboarding for future engineers

## Supporting Resources
- Interactive architecture diagram (Figma)
- Video library of common workflows
- Dedicated Slack channel for onboarding questions
- Weekly office hours with tech leads
- Curated reading list of internal documentation
